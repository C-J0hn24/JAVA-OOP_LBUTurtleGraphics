## Notes
This Portfolio Project Would not have been possible without the LBU and the online sources for learning..Thanks to all the free online learning sources as well as LBU libraries and documentations!

The reason for using online sources is mostly for Syntax as a beginner in Java I believe it is fair for me to make use of available online resources for this intention. In Programming, Syntaxes are what separates programming language from one another. I have used Python, C++ and Rust so coming up with a programming logic(for Game.java & TurtleGraphics.java) is not very difficult for these assignments Fundamentally every programming languages are the same/similar with same/similar core concepts and only thing each one unique is with features and Syntax.. 

I do not support stealing others work as well as incourage such behaviour and I do not act on it. After all I don't like my hard work to be stolen and someone else get credits for my hard work. 

Reference/tutorial Sources:

    Online learning Sites(Only for java Syntaxes):
    -Geeks For Geeks
    -W3School
    -Stack Overflow

    Online Youtube Learning Channels(mainly for making the game):
    -BroCode (Learned: Createing Timer in java + Edge Detection)
    -RyiSnow (I only looked at their impressive work)
    -macheads101 (Learned: Action key listner for an object)
